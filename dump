Agility is also useful.\nRun 1 primary agility, 1 primary crit chance/dmg, and 1 primary ATK.\n \n## GENERAL ADVICE\n\nLevel memoirs with promising substats to 9 to see if they're good. Stop if they aren't.\nIt's okay to upgrade whatever correct primary you get at the start.\nBe picky afterwards though; 2 substats of crit chance, dmg or ATK. Memoirs give a lot of gold, but they're pricy too. \nAfter 28% crit rate, you want 1.8% crit damage for every 1% crit rate you add.\n \n## HOW MEMOIRS WORK\n\n![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/868220526949191770/880867276130234460/unknown.png)\n\nThe first row may have any primary of ATK, DEF or HP. They can be a % based multiplier, or they can be a flat addition. The other two rows may also receive these stats. The second row may also receive crit rate or crit dmg. The third row may also receive agility. Any stat may be rolled for the substat stats. Substats are improved every 3 levels, meaning substats can be raised up to 5 times. The bottom of the image indicates the maximum value a substat can start at, as well as the maximum value a substat can end at presuming it was raised each time. Substats are improved by a random amount upon each level, for example crit dmg can receive a 4% boost or it can receive a 6% boost.\n \nFirst and foremost, it's not recommended to farm memoirs unless you can farm stage 10. There are plenty of ways to boost the power of your team otherwise, and all these things should be done before one considers beginning to farm for memoirs. Farming for memoirs takes a long time and many thousands of stamina to cobble together decent sets, so it's best not to waste your stamina in stages with suboptimal drop-rates; you should spend your time doing something you have to do to improve your power, like leveling and evolving your weapons and building an appropriate elemental deck to tackle a 10th stage.\t\n \nWith guidelines established and the basics of memoirs out of the way, the rest of the guide will be in-depth analysis on sets dungeons drop, strategies and requirements for clearing the boss along with more in-depth building advice. There will be a summary of every section, as well as an FAQ at the end. Feel free to submit questions!\n \n### DUNGEONS\n\n\t||THE DYNAST'S MEMORIES||\n\t|DROPS: 15% ATK SET, CRIT DMG SET, HP SET, DEF SET|\n\t|SUMMARY: This is the starter dungeon to farm to get some good PvE sets, to allow you to farm other things.|\n \n**OVERVIEW OF SETS**: This dungeon drops two out of three of the best PvE sets, the 15% ATK set and the CRIT DMG set. While the CRIT DMG set does have worse performance than the 15% ATK set, it's not by a significant amount. The force requirement here is the lowest out of any dungeons, making it a good starting point to build some power and start tackling more desirable dungeons if you find yourself unable to clear them when beginning memoir farming. The HP set and DEF set are not particularly useful for the majority of characters and content, and for players who like stallier, defensive teams there is a better set in a later dungeon for those purposes. \n \n**CLEARING STRATEGY**: This dungeon requires a wind deck. We want companions that boost wind damage and reduce water damage. The last slot can be any leveled companion for the utility of its skill. Gayle's EX weapon evolved can be a significant help here. Our only other free source of a wind EX weapon is Griff's gun. It would be usable if one had a character who could use guns. Other weapons will have to come from the gacha, whether it be evolved and ascended 3*s or evolved 4*s, preferably the latter. \n \nFor manual, with a wind deck we can clear this dungeon at the 75,000 force range. Use a few skills in the second wave to generate character gauge. When you meet the boss, wait until he uses his first skill. When he does, lead your combo with your companion that has elemental advantage, then use skills on your best damage dealer first to get their character skill up. Follow with your other two units to build combo, ending with your carry's character skill and the boss should go down in one sequence. \n \nAuto requirements for this dungeon will generally be in the 95,000 force range, and you may need to farm manually at the start to get together some sets that can do it consistently. Consider seeing if you can keep auto off for the first two waves and then turning auto on for the final wave to automate some parts. This boss gains a massive damage buff and spams attacks under 25% HP, so ending the fight swiftly once it reaches that point is important.\n \n\t||THE OFFICER'S MEMORIES||\n\t|DROPS: AGI SET, 30% ATK/-30% DEF SET, 30% DEF/-30% ATK SET, CRIT RATE SET|\n\t|SUMMARY: Farm this for the 30% ATK set for the highest damage output in PvE.|\n \n**OVERVIEW OF SETS**: This dungeon drops the PvE set with the highest damage output in the game, the 30% ATK set, and that is the main reason anyone would farm here as the other sets are not very desirable. Crit rate set has the lowest output in the game relative to other sets that improve our damage. This set is worse than running no set at all and instead taking crit rate or crit dmg primaries. It's also worse than running a broken set with an additional crit primary. The 30% DEF set is the best in the game for stalling. The AGI set is useless in PvE and there's little reason to use it over CDR set in PvP.\n \nCompare with Dynast; while we get the best PvE set in the game here, we also get the worst one, whereas Dynast drops two middle-ground PvE sets. Once your Dynast sets are situated, one could consider farming here for PvE purposes.\n \n**CLEARING STRATEGY**: This dungeon requires a dark deck. Officer is actually very difficult to auto. There are a few key conditions we have to meet to do it consistently. We need to be able to clear the first two waves very quickly to save as many skills as possible for the final wave. We need good damage output to be able to clear the additional mobs that spawn with the boss quickly. Finally, we need to be able to kill the boss before he uses his first AOE. \n \nThe first AOE has a chance to blind our party members, which wrecks consistency in auto if it lands. It takes very high damage output as well as reliable crit rate in order to clear this consistently on auto. We can use semi-auto strats here; keeping auto off until the final wave and targeting the boss manually can automate some of the process. \n \nFor manual, the boss is squishy. Just target the boss and have your skill rotations up and he should go down if you're running a proper dark deck. This can be done around the 85,000 force range. For reliable auto-clear, it's less about force and more about optimized memoirs, but 100,000 is a reasonable range.\n \n\t||THE WITCH'S MEMORIES||\n\t|DROPS: 15% ATK SET, CRIT DMG SET, CRIT SET, AGI SET|\n\t|SUMMARY: Clear this for the premium currency and don't farm it.|\n \n**OVERVIEW OF SETS**: Global has the advantage of having content rushed for us. This dungeon was good in JP as it was the primary place to farm the AGI set, which was the meta set in PvP before the advent of the CDR set, and it also provided you with two good PvE sets and one suboptimal one. However, since the next dungeon was rushed, there's little to no reason to farm here. There's better places for PvE sets and the PvP set is not particularly helpful.\n \n**CLEARING STRATEGY**: For clearing, the boss has a mechanic of needing to deal enough damage to prevent a big nuke that happens around 15 seconds into the fight, so you may consider saving some skill rotations for that.\n \n\t||ABERRANT MEMORIES||\n\t|DROPS: +10% CHAIN SET, 30% CDR SET, 15% DR SET, 30% ATK/DEF when under 50% HP for 30 seconds|\n\t|SUMMARY: Farm this for the 30% CDR set, which is optimal in PvP. Farm as much as you can before CH12 releases.|\n \n**OVERVIEW OF SETS**: The chain set here may have some niche usages for later PvE missions that limit the amount of times you can use a skill, but is otherwise going to be less damage output than improving our ATK or crit dmg. The DR set is not very useful; it's a temporary defensive bonus at the cost of damage which means the fight is going to take longer. However, it may have some niche usage for keeping units alive occasionally. \n \nThe CDR set is the biggest prize of this dungeon, as it's the optimal set to be using in PvP. Skill activation is another way of going first, and while normal attacks can miss kills occasionally, in PvP skills are almost certain death to most characters, especially after the regular attack phase. Furthermore, this is currently the best time to farm this dungeon, as with CH12 we will receive a new memoir set. \n \n**CLEARING STRATEGY**: This dungeon requires a fire deck. EX weapons that cover that are Akeha's and Lar's. Evolving them will significantly help with the consistency of your clear. This boss can check two things; first it checks your DPS, and if you fail to kill the boss it will spam big AOE damage at low health similar to the Dynast boss, which is a durability check. Leveled elemental companions are a huge boost here, the best being fire book and wind pod. A healer may be considered if your auto runs are inconsistent, 3* FX66 being the recommended one. \n \nAround 100,000 force with well-optimized memoirs will be what most compositions are looking at as an auto requirement. For manual play, it can be cleared in the 90,000 force range by saving our skills, previous strategies of trying turning off auto until wave 3 still apply.\n \n\t||PvE||\n\t|SUMMARY: Use ATK sets and crit dmg. Crit substats are ideal. Set can be broken for another crit primary as you build good sets.|\n \nATK sets and crit dmg sets are what you will be using here. For primaries, we'll take one crit rate or crit dmg depending on what our substats provide us. At 28% crit rate, we want 1.8% crit dmg per 1% crit rate we add for optimal returns on damage, so try to maintain that  of balance. The other two will be ATK primaries. \n \nSomething else to consider as we're beginning to build sets is that there are a lot of memoir sets we won't really be using, and given we need 3 strong memoirs in a single set, this can take a while to put together, since we need 3 sets too. If you end up with a good crit rate or crit dmg primary from a broken set, if it rolls well on substats it can be worth breaking up your set bonus if you have poor rolls. 2 set bonus would still be recommended. We get better returns out of crit primaries than we do ATK primaries, so you can just save crit primary rolls. Optimally speaking, we'll end up with a full set eventually, so consider this a temporary measure to boost your power as needed.\n \n\t||PvP||\n\t|SUMMARY: Use the CDR set and do not break it. Crit substats are ideal. Agility primary is important.|\n \nCDR set is king, and unlike in PvE under no circumstances can it be broken. Primary building is also different here, though a bit more straight-forward. In PvP you will want 1 AGI primary, 1 Crit primary and 1 ATK primary as a general baseline. Maintaining the aforementioned 1.8:1 crit dmg/crit rate ratio after 28% crit chance applies again here. \n \nYou may also consider saving any rolls that have excellent substats in the CDR set, even if they don't have these primaries. This set likely isn't going anywhere any time soon in PvP, and the potential for trying out different builds such as removing AGI for more ATK or ATK for more bulk could be a consideration in the future.\n \n# FAQ\n\n**Q**: Should I sell flat stats?\n\n**A**: Flat ATK is solid for a few reasons. The primary one is it's really damn hard to get memoirs with amazing substats, so getting more chances to get those highly desirable crit rolls can boost your power a lot faster. Past that, it has to do with characters that have ATK in the 3-4.5k range not losing *too* much out of the flat ATK set, though anyone with over 3000 ATK will strictly get less ATK from the 600 cap of the flat ATK primary vs. 20% ATK from a % based primary. Flat HP/DEF can provide a larger amount of HP/DEF on many units, though generally we don't build for bulk. \n \n---\n\n**Q**: Is, say, ATK set bonus any different from ATK% as a primary stat on a memoir?\n\n**A**: Set bonuses apply differently in the formula than primary stats. A primary stat of 20% ATK on a memoir is only applied to the character's base ATK; for instance, a character with a base ATK of 1000 would get 200 ATK. A set bonus of 15% ATK would be added to any Vigor (or ATK%) passives the character or weapon has. This part of the formula multiplies with your character's ATK after weapons and companion are considered, which is a significantly higher number!\n \n---\n\n**Q**: Should I break my sets?\n\n**A**: In the preliminary stages of building sets, breaking your set can give you a higher output if you get particularly good rolls. Consider saving crit primaries of various sets with good substat rolls, though be aware that eventually you will just throw away these sets. While it's not exact as the character page doesn't reflect your ATK stat properly, ATK * crit * critdmg can give you a general idea of your average damage output.\n \n---\n\n**Q**: When should I be satisfied with my memoirs?\n\n**A**: 15-20% crit chance or dmg combined on subslot is a solid memoir. Past that is a lot of stamina to optimize a bit more. Consider if you have anything better that you should be doing, like evolving weapons, leveling companions and if you have the stomach for it, cube farming. Bear in mind we only need 27 memoirs for Subjugation in the future, and you will reach that point quickly. \n\n---\n\n**Q**: Is Agility worth it in PvE?\n\n**A**: The only thing that agility influences is turn order, which isn't very significant given this is a game built around building combos with your character's skills. Agility has no influence on skills interrupting turn order, so no, agility isn't useful in PvE. This is purely a PvP stat.\n \n## CREDITS\n\n**Yuuru** - Without his [Youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeSQF_NZyu2WtjV9EbJkEbQ) and many, many hours of work reverse-engineering all the formulae in NieR, there are so many things we wouldn't know.

8	event	Record: The Cage of Reincarnation	# Record: The Cage of Reincarnation \n\n#### Story 1\nBuilt to protect mankind, two androids fight the machines. The female is 2B: A powerful warrior who fights on the front line. The male is 9S: A support unit who aids 2B from afar. When they fight as one, nothing can stop them. But 9S has a secret: He wants to free 2B from her world of unending war. \n\nOne day, as they pursue yet another enemy, they find themselves making their way through a massive limestone cavern. Foes attack them and fall, one after the other. The machines stand no chance against them. \n\n#### Story 2\nThey proceed deep into the cavern, then deeper still. Finally, they reach their destination. The darkness is absolute. But the moment they step forward, they are enveloped in a brilliant red light. Only then does 9S realize his mistake. The enemy has been using electronic camouflage. There are machine lifeforms here—dozens of them. Suddenly, 2B emits a heartrending scream. She is infected with a virus—a weapon designed to destroy an android from the inside out. Her eyes begin to glow red. It is a worst-case scenario, and 9S knows the best thing for him to do is abandon the fight and retreat. But he refuses to even consider this option. He will save 2B. He must. For that is his purpose in life. In a desperate maneuver, he links himself to her infected mind and begins diving into its deepest, most hidden parts.\n\n#### Story 3\n2B's mind is a maze—a labyrinth. Finally, he throws open a door and beholds a strange sight: Flickering memories of himself, all from the perspective of 2B. He sees himself in a forest of metal. A frozen ocean. A boiling desert. But he remembers none of this. And all the memories end in exactly the same way: With 2B killing him. She does so over. And over. And over. And over. And over. And over. But for each death, there is also a first meeting. Each time, he says, "People who know me well usually call me Nines." He says this dozens of times. Hundreds. \n\n#### Story 4\n\nIn another part of 2B's mind, 9S locates the virus and disables it. The enemy stumbles in response to the unexpected counterattack, and the two take advantage of the situation to escape. Later, 2B reports the completion of their mission. \n\nAs 9S lends his damaged companion a shoulder, he thinks: *"Why does 2B kill me? Why are my memories erased? And why do we always meet again?" *\n\nThe answer eludes him, and he cannot find the words to ask. However... So long as he remains in her mind... So long as a part of him is in her memory... He doesn't care how many times she kills him. \n\nTheir fate is a never-ending spiral, and they cling to its threads. So 9S walks on through the darkness. \n	\N	\N	en	2	2	2021-08-29 18:57:40.274+00	2021-08-29 19:45:07.645+00	record-the-cage-of-reincarnation
2	event	Record: Sunset Port	# Record: Sunset Port \n\n#### STORY 1\n\nA lone woman silently walks beside a sparkling sea where sunlight glistens on the water. She is elegance personified, her black swimwear giving her the appearance of a gossamer butterfly. This place is not her home. Rather. she has come here to complete a single mission. She has been tasked with slipping aboard a nearby ship and stealing a person's life. For this woman is an assassin. But though this is not her home, the place is not entirely unfamiliar. She has been here once before—long, long ago. As she gazes out at the light playing over the water,\n\nshe thinks back on that time.\n\nShe was young then—so young—her spirit not yet worn thin by the passing of years.\n\nShe journeyed to this place as part of her rigorous training, tasked with locating a corrupt politician from a rival country. Then, as now, the port was a lively place, with ships from around the world moving in and out on a regular basis. It was a city filled with all manner and races of people, and no one paid any mind to the innocent girl who walked among their number. This was exactly how she wanted it; the more they overlooked her, the easier it would be to gain the information she sought. After a bit, she learned her target would soon be attending a political gathering aboard a ship. But she did not know the identity of the ship, and their number was legion. If she were to sneak aboard the wrong one, all of her careful planning would be for naught. But as the girl pondered this dilemma... A shock raced through her body. Focused as she had been on the ships, she did not notice the young boy running along the pier and had smashed straight into him. \n\n#### STORY 2\nThe girl on a mission collided with a young boy along the water's edge. Though clad in fine clothing, he raised his voice in a most undignified howl as he lay upon the ground. Blood trickled from an injured knee. As passers-by began to turn and stare, the girl knew she could not leave the boy as he was.\n\nAs she began tending to his wound, she asked him: "Where are your parents? Can I take you to them?" But the boy's lowered head only shook back and forth slowly.\n\n"I don't know where my father is," he said in a wavering voice\n\n"All I know is that he's leaving soon for an important meeting."\n\nThe boy's voice hitched on the edge of a sob. As it did so, a thought came to the girl. *Perhaps his father is the one I seek*. If the boy was the son of a politician, it would explain his fine dress. With this in mind, the girl cheerfully agreed to help him find his missing parent. His eyes glistening with tears, the boy handed her something in a wordless gesture of thanks. It was a small, scuffed figurine of a kind and dignified woman. She was the heroine of a fairy tale told and retold in the boy's native land.\n\n"She's you!" said the boy as he broke out into a smile. \n\nBut the girl just looked away. Because she knew she did not help the boy out of kindness. \n\n#### STORY 3\n\nThe girl needed to locate the politician's ship as soon as possible. Grasping the boy's hand, she began pulling him up the beach, hoping against hope he would see a familiar sight. Suddenly, his face brightened. "Father!" he cried as he slipped from her hand and began to run. The girl took off after him. Turning around, the father smiled as his son leapt into his waiting arms.\n\n"There you are!" he said.\n\n"You almost made me miss my meeting" \n\nThe father tilted his head to mutter a word of thanks to the girl, then began carrying his son onto the ship. A sliver of a smile flickered across the girl's face before vanishing as quickly as it came. Almost as if it was never there at all. This was her ship. All that remained was to make her way aboard and learn what she could.\n\nShe immediately began formulating her plan. But as her mind whirled, she noticed a woman moving silently into place behind her. The woman was familiar, for she came from the girl's own house. She had been sent to the port to monitor the girl and ensure the mission was a success. But they were never supposed to interact. Her appearance could only mean one thing: The situation had changed.\n\nThe woman leaned down and whispered fiercely in the girl's ear:\n\n"He means to declare war. We must act. Leave none alive." \n\n#### STORY 4\n\nThe deck was slick. The corpses were still. Her blade was red. In less time than it takes to draw a breath, the girl and her monitor had slaughtered every last person on the ship. The woman wiped the blood from her blade with a practiced hand and spared a glance at her charge.\n\n"Ever seen this many bodies before?" Though the girl would not meet her gaze, she nodded slowly.\n\n"Of course. Too many times to count." The woman chuckled.\n\n"Right, right. Forgot you're the boss's daughter." The girl sheathed her blade in silence.\n\nBy chance, her eyes darted to the water, where she saw the figurine she had received slowly bobbing up and down. Hearing the boy's words in her mind, she dropped her eyes. He was right. She was exactly like the figure—a helpless thing being tossed about, an assassin forever at the mercy of the waves.\n\nYears have passed since that day. The woman shakes her head to clear her thoughts as a bell rings out announcing the arrival of a ship. She knows her targets are aboard. They are foreign politicians who scheme to infiltrate her homeland. Her mission is to prevent that—by whatever means necessary. The woman stands some distance away and watches the passengers disembark. One particularly large man steps off clad in nothing but a loincloth. *Must have been hot in there*, thinks the woman idly. But the next person to step off brings a small shiver of delight. It is her target. Her lord's orders were clear: She was to prevent the invasion of her homeland. She was to kill the target with all speed. It was the same reason she had stained another ship in crimson all those long years ago. The reason why she took the life of the young boy. And the reason why she still remembers the figurine to this day. The one that was exactly like her.\n\nA haze of melancholy passes over her face as she looks out over the distant horizon. *I wonder where that thing drifted off to*. But she shakes off her momentary fugue and begins walking after her target. The footprints she leaves in the sand are stolen away by the waves.\n	\N	\N	en	2	2	2021-08-29 18:55:46.182+00	2021-08-29 19:45:16.648+00	record-sunset-port
4	quest	Lars	# Lars \n\n#### STORY 1\n\nI inhale a lungful of battlefield air, rich with a mix of gunsmoke and blood. Our operation was a smashing success, but while my fellow soldiers are content going back to base and celebrating our victory, I'm heading out on a new mission. Because the only time I feel alive now is when I fight. Revenge drove me. It's all that ever drove me. But then I ended up killing my own father. And on top of that, it turns out the people I called my family were actually my enemies. What a goddamn joke, right? Anybody else laughing here? \n\nWhen I return to reality, I see piles of corpses everywhere. It's all my doing, this carnage, but instead of rage or sorrow, I just feel a strange sense of calm. Honestly, killing is the only thing that brings me peace anymore. Suddenly, an explosion shakes the ground—a close one. The sky turns red as flames arc up toward the heavens. As I stare at this crimson sky, my heart begins to race. I set out in search of someone to fight, hoping to calm my jangled nerves.\n\n#### STORY 2\n\nThe war has turned in our favor. The enemies we don't kill we send running into the night... But it still isn't enough. I find myself picking my way across a viscera-strewn battlefield just in case we missed a straggler. After a bit, I sense someone hiding behind a collapsed house. Battle fever floods my senses. I raise my sword and leap out of hiding, prepared to strike down my terrible foe. But there, crouching on the ground, is a little girl. \n\n*Goddammit, I think. We're under orders to protect civilians, which means I gotta drag this kid around with me until I find a place to dump her off. What a pain in the ass.*\nI extend a bloody hand and grab the girl by the arm. She screams. I don't care. I give her a good yank and start walking. She responds by pinwheeling her other arm and toppling face-down into the mud. That's when I realize the kid is blind.\n\n#### STORY 3\n\nThe girl, still sitting on the ground, grabs my hand and says, \n"Oh no, mister! You're bleeding. Are you okay?\n" The question hits me wrong, and I smack her hand away. After that, we wait in a long, uncomfortable silence.\n\n"It's not my blood," I say finally, as much to break the silence as anything else. I wipe my hand on my pants to clear off as much gore as I can, then help the kid up. Her hands are so damn *soft*. I'd forgotten hands could be soft. The only thing mine are good for any more is murder;\nit's hard to believe her hands and mine are the same thing. \n\nWith no other choice, I throw her across my back and start working my way back to base. I can feel the kid's warmth against me. And there, in the strange silence you always get on a battlefield after a fight... The only thing I can hear is the beating of my own heart.\n\n#### STORY 4\n\nEventually, we make it to a field hospital. It's a nice place, actually, with sunlight coming through the windows and wind rustling the trees. The kid seems okay with it, at least. She lies on a bed, her gaze trained on the window to her side. \n\n"Hey, kid," I ask her. \n"What were you doing on the ground back there?" \n\nShe pauses for a second, then speaks. She tells me how she'd been neglected by her parents her whole life before they finally abandoned her once the war came home.\n\nWhen her story is done, she turns her head in my direction and asks:\n"What color is the sky right now, mister?" I take a look out the window.\n\n"Blue," I say. \n"A nice, deep blue." \n\nShe closes her eyes—I have no idea why—and begins to try and imagine what blue might look like. I don't know why I feel uneasy here, but I do. Something about being near this kid puts me on edge. My heart is racing again but in a different way than the discomfort I've felt for my entire life. And as I try to identify what this strange feeling is, I picture the color of the sky in the girl's imagination.\n	\N	\N	en	2	2	2021-08-29 18:56:24.18+00	2021-08-29 20:14:47.012+00	lars
7	quest	Griff	# Griff \n\n#### STORY 1\n\n"What should I do...?" I sit in the briefing room, continuing to turn the problem over and over in my mind. I've been up all night thinking about it and am now beyond exhausted. See, I have to write a telegram to my family back home, but I can't think of a single thing to say. My squad came back victorious from battle a few days ago, at which point everyone sat down and wrote their parents just like always. I joined the army eight years ago... And I haven't contacted my family a single time. It would be strange to send them something now. Crazy. And every time I think back on my time with them, I come up with more excuses not to do it.\n\n#### STORY 2\n\nMy fellow soldiers are loud and boisterous, like always. I begin to wonder what kinds of messages they send. I sit still and listen in, hoping it will give me a better idea of what to write.\n\nOne man says he sent his parents a telegram about being promoted to captain. It's not true he made it up—but his parents love hearing stories about how successful he is, so he figures it's okay to stretch the truth a little. \n\nAnother man's telegrams always focus on memories he and his parents made together. Today's letter is all about how they used to play ball with each other; he claims it will distract them from how lonely they are now that he's gone.\n\nEveryone speaks so cheerfully about the thought they put into telegrams home. And though they are my comrades—and my friends—I can't help but feel the gulf between our lives.\nThe worlds we grew up in were too different. \n\n#### STORY 3\n\nHere's the thing: Ours is a country that values military might above all else, but my parents? They're both anti-war activists. Needless to say, their beliefs earned me more than my share of dirty looks and unkind whispers when I was a kid. \n\nOne day, the army shot and killed my father. What a joke, right? He's spent his entire life preaching peace, then died without accomplishing a single damn thing. I took a lesson from that: Give your life some meaning. Make it *matter*. Later, I decided to join the army and climb the ranks—but when I told Mom about my plan, she said I was insane. The moment she spoke those words, I knew I had to get out of that house. So I slammed the door and stormed off, then spent years trying and failing to forget the empty look in her eyes as I departed.\n\nIn an ironic twist, I never did climb the ladder the way I swore I would. But today, after eight years spent trying to bury every last memory of my family, I finally figure out the telegram I want to send: It's an apology.\n\n#### STORY 4\n\nI'm nervous after I send the telegram. What if she doesn't respond? Hell, what if she disowns me? I couldn't blame her for that. But before I can think too hard about it, I get her response:\n\n*Honey, I'm just so glad you're alive.*\n\nWhy was my father an anti-war activist, anyway? Why did my joining the army weigh so heavily on my mother? I don't have a clue, because I've spent my whole life actively avoiding a search for those answers. The mistakes I made in the past will never go away. But as I think of my military companions and their families, another thought comes to me: I risked my life for these people. Gave everything for them. And I'm more proud of that fact than anything else. But while I salute them, I doubt it will convey these feelings that well up within me.\n	\N	\N	en	2	2	2021-08-29 18:57:27.751+00	2021-08-29 20:15:18.534+00	griff
3	quest	Gayle	#Gayle \n\n#### STORY1\n\nI am on a journey of revenge. The kingdom razed my home, killed my sister, and took everything from me. But its lust for power fed an unsustainable hunger for war, and it eventually collapsed. Still, scattered remnants of its forces remain. And I won't stop until every last one of them is dead. I tarry for a while in a small village. Under the midday sun, I hear a voice call for help. I see a kingdom soldier raise a fist and bring it down on the head of a woman. He moves to deliver a second blow. I leap in the way and take it myself before swiftly ending his life. The woman begins thanking me profusely... But I ignore her. I fight for revenge—not to save lives or spread justice. As I move to leave, the woman bars my path. Asking to see my prosthetic arm, she draws in close. She examines it carefully, looking it up and down. It was damaged when I took the blow the soldier intended for her. Though I try to explain that I can repair my arm, she waves me off with a dismissive grunt.\n<br><br>\n"We've a skilled engineer in the village," she says.<br>\n"Come along." Before I can think to protest further, she takes my hand in hers and leads me off. \n<br><br>\n#### STORY2\n\nI am guided to an engineer so that my arm might be repaired. The engineer is indeed skilled, but lacks the needed parts for repairs—and unfortunately, it will be some time before they're available. Still determined to show her thanks, the woman huffs loudly, grabs my good arm, and drags me off anew.\n<br><br>\nWe end up in the village pub. She gathers the drinkers around her and spins an epic tale of how I saved her from the kingdom brigand. Soon. I find myself regaled with food, drink, and song from all corners. I take a bite of something and nearly swoon; I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a hot meal. When the woman leans in and asks how it tastes. I feel an unfamiliar smile slowly make its way across my lips. \n<br><br>\nHow long has it been since I smiled? Weeks? Years? More? \n<br><br>\nI thought I'd lost the ability to do such a thing long ago. \n<br><br>\n#### STORY 3\n\nEventually, the parts arrive and my arm is finally repaired. The woman asks me how it feels, and I'm both surprised and delighted that it seems to move more smoothly than before. As I test it out, the engineer smiles at me and says.\n"Consider this my way of saying thanks for saving my wife." \n<br><br>\nIt turns out the engineer and the woman are married. She turns red as he talks about everything he loves about her. I can only chuckle and show a wry smile as I listen. Finally, she can take no more attention and leads me out of the shop. As we walk, she tells me they have been married almost three years. She also thanks me again for my actions from before. This time, I manage to face the woman and thank her for the assistance. I tell her my work in the village is done and I will be on my way  But that's not the entire truth. I'm also afraid of what might happen if I grow used to the warmth and kindness of others. The villagers all gather at the edge of town to see me off. \n<br><br>\n"Come see us again real soon!" says the woman. <br>\nAs I walk away, the last thing I see is her small hand happily waving goodbye. \n<br><br>\n#### STORY 4\n\nIt wasn't long after leaving the village that I heard the news: A soldier was attacking the village in revenge. Before I even know it, I am on my feet and running like the very wind itself. \n<br><br>\nI find the village in flames. The soldier is roaming about madly as he scours the village in search of every last person he can find.<br>\n"That man was family!" he cries as he puts another house to the torch. \n<br><br>\n"All of you will pay for his death with your lives!" <br>\nMy vision is fire. \n<br><br>\nBefore I even have the chance to feel my building rage, I engage the man in battle. My arm works even better than before. In a moment, I cut him down like a dog. \n<br><br>\nWhen the deed is done, I walk around the village in search of survivors. In the very last house, I find the woman and the engineer with their arms wrapped around each other and their bodies still. I thought I had saved them—saved *all* of them—from a terrible fate that first night... But my actions had only been the impetus for an even greater tragedy. These innocent people had been caught in the cycle of revenge, and now their lifeless eyes stare accusingly up at me. \n<br><br>\n*Your power did this. Your hate. Your thirst for retribution.*\n<br><br>\nAnd you know what? They're right. *I* did this. It is all because of *me*. As I fight, I only add more links to the chain of revenge—but If I stop, the remaining soldiers will continue to commit their horrid atrocities. So I have to fight. I have no choice. But in so doing, will I, too, become an object of hatred in this world of neverending slaughter? All that lays before my eyes is a crimson world of blood and fire.	\N	\N	en	2	2	2021-08-29 18:56:08.599+00	2021-08-29 20:15:58.537+00	gayle
5	quest	Dimos	#Dimos \n\n#### STORY1\n\nWind rustles in the trees. Crows caw softly in the gloaming. As I scan the quiet forest in search of any possible threat, the prince at my side murmurs, "Its so peaceful here."\n<br><br>\nHe is here in search of a way to lead our country out of war. And as he travels from nation to nation preaching his message of peace, I walk at his side to protect him from those who refuse to listen. But I am a clockwork man created for war, and no matter how much time we spend together, the truth of his message continues to elude me. I draw close to the prince as he contemplates the setting sun. I wonder why he would think this place to be "peaceful." Perhaps it has something to do with the red hues of dusk? \n<br><br>\n#### STORY2\n\nAs the prince's disease worsened, so did grow his impatience. It would seem he desires to achieve peace as quickly as possible. So when I suggest we rest in a church until he feels better, it takes a good deal of effort to get him to agree.\n<br><br>\nToday again, the prince's condition is poor, so we wait for nightfall in the church. I take this opportunity to ask him: "What is a peaceful world?"<br>\nHe looks at me with surprise, but a willful flame burns in his eyes. After a moment, a thin smile crosses his lips. He reaches out, puts a hand on my chest, and says,<br>\n"It means you never have to hurt *here*."<br>\nIt must be a different sort of pain from wounds as I know them. He does not notice my lack of understanding and continues to talk. I simply nod my head, hoping it will bring him energy.\n<br><br>\n#### STORY 3\n\nThe disease spreads. The prince's body withers and fades. When he can no longer stand, I travel alone to nearby villages in search of any food or medicine they can spare. In the villages, I see people driven mad by the horrors of war. They grieve for lost family. They curse their empty bellies. And they all turn their weapons on me—the clockwork man. \n<br><br>\nOne day, I find a single apple in the woods. My prince lacks the strength to eat it on his own, so I chew small bites and feed it to him as a mother bird would its own young. As I see his haggard cheeks and hear his final, gasping breath... I feel a pain deep within my chest and finally realize the truth of everything that my prince has been fighting for. \n<br><br>\n*It means you never have to hurt here,*\n<br><br>\nhe had said.

6	quest	Argo	#Argo \n\n#### STORY1\n\nMy life's mission is to explore the entire world, for only great hardships can make me feel alive. Everything besides adventuring is merely a footnote. I wager I'll feel this way until the day I die.<br><br>\n\nI've faced the challenge of many unexplored regions in my life: Mountains untrodden by man, scorched deserts, frozen islands, pitch-black forests, caves that lead to an endless abyss... So many adventures I can't even remember them all.<br><br>\n\nJust the other day, my wife and I learned that our long-awaited first child was in her belly! Of course, I wanted to help however I could, Which is why I left our snug house in the snowy mountains and began the long climb down. My destination is a small nearby town. How long has it been since I've made this trip? My wife is usually the one who does the shopping. In any case, I don't mind doing what I must to help out during this time.<br><br>\n\n#### STORY2\n\nI haven't tasted the bustle of civilization in a long while, but I pay it little mind as I search for the shops my wife told me about. Heh. It's funny how quickly I get turned around in the streets—if only I was navigating a mountain path instead!<br><br>\n\nAs I wander about, a merchant calls me over. He recognizes me as a renowned adventurer, and he says he has items he wants me to look at. He has a keen eye, this shopkeeper! Ha ha ha! The shopkeep lays out several items across his display: flint to create bonfires, a talisman that wards off illness, and ice that never melts, even under the hottest of suns. All extremely useful items on any adventure! He claims these items are all in high demand, so I buy them on the spot. Lady luck is really smiling on me today!<br><br>\n\n#### STORY 3\n\nThe moment I leave the stall, reality smacks me in the face: I spent all our money and didn't get a thing my wife wanted! Ah, well. Nothing to be done about it now. So I sell my coat and use the money to buy what I came for. Not the smartest thing to go coatless in the dead of winter, but I'm hearty—I'll find a way to survive. Mine is a body forged in the fires of countless journeys. It'd take more than this to do me in!<br><br>\n\nAs I make my way back up the mountain, a blizzard suddenly comes upon me. <br>\nI'm cold—*really* cold—but I spy a nearby rocky shelter and decide to hunker down, As I settle in, I try to start a bonfire with my new flint. But the moment I strike it, the damn thing shatters into pieces. It's a dud—talk about unlucky.<br><br>\n\n#### STORY 4\n\nSomehow, I manage to make it home through the wind and snow. When my wife sees me, she demands to know why I was wandering around without my coat on. so I tell her the whole crazy story. Still, I'm pretty excited about my two remaining treasures!<br><br>\n\nThat night, I am plagued by a high fever. You expect this kind of thing when you walk around in a blizzard without a coat, but it means my talisman that wards off illness is *also* a bust! Another dud! Can you believe it? Trying to kill the fever dead, I put my never-melt ice in a sack and set it on my forehead. I bet you can guess how this goes... I take the bag of lukewarm water off my head and toss it aside in disgust. That damn shopkeep took me for all I had! Still, it's not all a loss;\nI live on a snowy mountain... So if it's ice I need, I just have to walk outside! Ha ha ha ha ha! \n\n	\N	\N	en	2	2	2021-08-29 18:57:02.354+00	2021-08-29 20:17:13.606+00	argo
9	event	Record: Garden of Benediction	# Record: Garden of Benediction \n\n#### Story 1\nOnce, a small girl lived in a town far away. Her family is poor, and though times are rough, she lives her life to its fullest as best she can. Her days are often spent playing alone in a ruin outside of town. She has no friends, so this run-down building is her only companion.\n\nHer days are ones of hardship. But today, she is filled with life and energy. Or so she desperately wants to believe. For today is her birthday. But there is no delicious feast waiting for her. No presents. And no one to celebrate her special day—not even her parents. So instead, she celebrates alone. \n\n"Happy birthday!" she cries to herself, causing warmth to blossom in her chest. She spins in a circle, imagining herself as a beautiful ballerina. She sings. She dances. She tries all the fun things she can think to do. Because this is her birthday party. A day to forget the pain of everyday life. And more than anything else, she wants this day to be special. \n\n#### Story 2\nThe lonely birthday party continues. The next event takes place on a craggy stone table. The girl begins forming something out of dirt and mud. It is a grand birthday cake—one far too big for a single person to consume. It seems impossible that someone so small can construct such a thing, let alone that she could build it at all. For her mother and father have never celebrated her birthday. Though she had always wanted a party, she knew her parents were too destitute to do such a thing. And as a result, she has no idea what a real cake is supposed to look like. Or taste like. Or smell like. The only thing she knows for certain is that they are delightful. More than anything, she wants to share a cake with her family someday. And with that dream in mind, she continues to build her creation. \n\n#### Story 3\nHer dirt cake slowly takes shape. Though it is a tad off-kilter, she finally completes it. But as she gazes at her creation, she notices something is missing. She needs to add something very, very important. And she knows exactly what it is: The cake has no candles. She begins searching for branches that can act as a suitable substitute. She knows she needs as many straight little twigs as her age. After a bit, she begins breaking off branches and whittling them down. She will not compromise on the candles. A cake only becomes grand with proper candles, after all. \n\nSuddenly, a sweet scent wafts over her. It is the most lovely thing she has ever smelled. Was someone baking treats nearby, maybe? The question lingers in her mind as she finishes collecting her sticks. But when she turns back to her cake, she is greeted by an unbelievable sight. Her creation of dirt and mud has transformed into a real cake. \n\n#### Story 4\nThe cake the girl worked so hard to make has somehow become real. White cream. Colorful fruit. The girl cannot hide her joy. Her cheers of celebration quickly turn into song. The happiest birthday song ever sung fills the quiet of the ruin. And in the far-off shadows, something watches. It is a strange creature—neither human nor animal. It had been unable to turn away from the girl as she played, and could not help but interfere. Even though such a thing is forbidden. \n\n"Just..." \n"Just for today." \n\nThe strange creature holds the warmest wishes for the girl. And seeing her smiling face, it knows these wishes have come true. \n\n"Happy birthday, little one." "Here's a present from Mama." \n\n\n	\N	\N	en	2	2	2021-08-29 18:57:59.617+00	2021-08-29 21:46:27.554+00	record-garden-of-benediction
1	quest	Akeha	# Akeha \n\n#### STORY 1\nRed spikes top the walls that surround my family's manor. They stand there proudly as they stretch up to the sky, and the color reminds all who pass of blood. But these spikes are not there to keep intruders at bay; our family has no need of such defenses. None ever approach our house, which is known as The Demon's Den. And if some foolhardy brigand ever did so dare, he would soon learn that a death on the spikes is much, much sweeter than what awaits behind our doors. No, the spikes are not meant to keep people out; they are there to keep the demons in.<br><br>\n\n\n#### STORY 2\nOur training is harsh. Our work cruel. Our teachings inhumane. One might expect that there would be those who are unable to stand it, and scheme to escape. And in fact, there have been a few brave souls who attempted to cross the wall. But every single one of them was killed; the crimson spikes serve to remind us of this fact.<br><br>\n\nI personally knew one man who plotted escape. He was the elder brother of the lord in power—my uncle. My uncle objected to an assassination demanded of him. But when he tried to flee, he met the same fate as those who did so before him: his head put on display for all to see.<br><br>\n\n#### STORY 3\nMy family's teachings are impossibly strict—and as the daughter of the lord, I was not exempt. If anything, my teachings were even more severe. It was only natural given my standing. There are no smiles in a house of assassins; we are showered with naught but shouting and demands.<br><br>\n\nMy uncle, however, always had time to spare a grin for me. He was the only one who ever did. But on that grim day, his smile vanished. His younger brother cut him down to set an example, and his face would forevermore be frozen in a rictus of pain. I learned many hard truths on that day: I would never cross the spikes. Kindness has no meaning. My life is nothing but orders and blood.<br><br>\n\n#### STORY 4\nTime passed and I took over the household from my father. Now, I am able to freely come and go as I please. Yet somehow, I remain an assassin. A thought came to me just now:<br>\nDo I blame the spikes for my murderous ways?<br>\nAm I a bloodthirsty ghoul who uses my job and those spikes as an excuse to kill?<br>\nDo I willingly<br>\nreturn because it is the only place where I will ever find acceptance?<br><br>\n\nAs I look up from outside the wall, the familiar sky stings my eyes. Did I...make a mistake somewhere? The same questions roll ever onward in my mind yet all I can do is surrender myself to my own dark thoughts.\n	\N	\N	en	2	2	2021-08-29 18:55:20.787+00	2021-08-29 20:17:58.586+00	akeha

She's not being reasonable—and I'm going to tell her so!\n\nUh oh. The moment I open my mouth, she launches into a rant about all of her woes: \nI don't understand women. I'm crude. I'm insensitive. She starts unloading all sorts of stuff on me. Blah blah blah. Well, I'm sure as hell not going to just lie back and take all that!\n\n"You know, this is what I hate about you!" I snarl. \n"You're always bringing up these stupid unrelated issues!"\n\nThe moment the words leave my mouth, I know I've gone too far; one look at her face is all I need to realize that. She points to the door—and I know what *that* means. And while part of me is annoyed as hell at all of this... I decide to get out while the getting's good. \n\n####STORY2\n\nI escape to the mess hall. My friends come up to me and ask what's the matter—guess I look a little pale. But when I tell them how I just had a blow-up with the wife, their concern dissolves into peals of laughter. After they have their fun, they tell me I'm the one at fault. Each one has a different strategy I can use to make amends. As they talk, I realize they're pretty good pals, all in all.\n\nI decide to put their plan into motion. I return to the room and pick my wife up off her feet. She seems perplexed, but intrigued—which is good. I then start spinning her around the room in a dance, showing off my strength as well as my moves. But of course, I take it too far. By the time I realize it, her face has progressed from confusion to downright fury. So before I can wreck it more, I dash out of the room. \n\n\n####STORY 3\n\nAs I think about what to do, the unit commander appears. Word of our marital squabble has spread throughout the base. He warns me it will be a hindrance to our operations. Since he seems to care, I tell him what happened and ask for his advice. He chuckles a little. He then tells me he doesn't have any ideas—and doesn't care enough to think of any. But then he gives me a piece of "paper"—something people apparently used long, long ago in order to make amends. I don't know what he's thinking, but he's not the kind of man to act without purpose. I decide his words must have some meaning. Apparently "paper" is a relic of the past used for writing. That's when it comes to me:\n\nSince I usually say too much, I'll write a "letter" to my wife instead. \n\n####STORY 4\n\nBut I'm not sure what usually goes into a letter. Maybe I should start with thanks for everything she does for me every day? No, wait. An apology is probably better. I write letter after letter as I think of my wife. I write, then erase. Write, then erase.\n\nWrite, then erase. After ten or so attempts, the letter is finally complete. I go home and hand it to my wife, whose eyes go wide. This could just be because a letter is so unfamiliar, but more likely it's because I'm genuinely apologizing. Once she reads the letter, she smiles and looks at me. Then she wraps me up in a hug... It would seem all is forgiven. My messy writing on the crumpled paper was simple: "I will protect and love you with all of my life. This I swear..." No matter what the future may hold. \n\n	\N	6	6	2021-08-23 19:55:23.992+00	2021-08-24 13:00:52.672+00	en	\N

But its lust for power fed an unsustainable hunger for war, and it eventually collapsed. Still, scattered remnants of its forces remain. And I won't stop until every last one of them is dead. I tarry for a while in a small village. Under the midday sun, I hear a voice call for help. I see a kingdom soldier raise a fist and bring it down on the head of a woman. He moves to deliver a second blow. I leap in the way and take it myself before swiftly ending his life. The woman begins thanking me profusely... But I ignore her. I fight for revenge—not to save lives or spread justice. As I move to leave, the woman bars my path. Asking to see my prosthetic arm, she draws in close. She examines it carefully, looking it up and down. It was damaged when I took the blow the soldier intended for her. Though I try to explain that I can repair my arm, she waves me off with a dismissive grunt.\n<br><br>\n"We've a skilled engineer in the village," she says.<br>\n"Come along." Before I can think to protest further, she takes my hand in hers and leads me off. \n<br><br>\n#### STORY2\n\nI am guided to an engineer so that my arm might be repaired. The engineer is indeed skilled, but lacks the needed parts for repairs—and unfortunately, it will be some time before they're available. Still determined to show her thanks, the woman huffs loudly, grabs my good arm, and drags me off anew.\n<br><br>\nWe end up in the village pub. She gathers the drinkers around her and spins an epic tale of how I saved her from the kingdom brigand. Soon. I find myself regaled with food, drink, and song from all corners. I take a bite of something and nearly swoon; I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a hot meal. When the woman leans in and asks how it tastes. I feel an unfamiliar smile slowly make its way across my lips. \n<br><br>\nHow long has it been since I smiled? Weeks? Years? More? \n<br><br>\nI thought I'd lost the ability to do such a thing long ago. \n<br><br>\n#### STORY 3\n\nEventually, the parts arrive and my arm is finally repaired. The woman asks me how it feels, and I'm both surprised and delighted that it seems to move more smoothly than before. As I test it out, the engineer smiles at me and says.\n"Consider this my way of saying thanks for saving my wife." \n<br><br>\nIt turns out the engineer and the woman are married. She turns red as he talks about everything he loves about her. I can only chuckle and show a wry smile as I listen. Finally, she can take no more attention and leads me out of the shop. As we walk, she tells me they have been married almost three years. She also thanks me again for my actions from before. This time, I manage to face the woman and thank her for the assistance. I tell her my work in the village is done and I will be on my way  But that's not the entire truth. I'm also afraid of what might happen if I grow used to the warmth and kindness of others. The villagers all gather at the edge of town to see me off. \n<br><br>\n"Come see us again real soon!" says the woman. <br>\nAs I walk away, the last thing I see is her small hand happily waving goodbye. \n<br><br>\n#### STORY 4\n\nIt wasn't long after leaving the village that I heard the news: A soldier was attacking the village in revenge. Before I even know it, I am on my feet and running like the very wind itself. \n<br><br>\nI find the village in flames. The soldier is roaming about madly as he scours the village in search of every last person he can find.<br>\n"That man was family!" he cries as he puts another house to the torch. \n<br><br>\n"All of you will pay for his death with your lives!" <br>\nMy vision is fire. \n<br><br>\nBefore I even have the chance to feel my building rage, I engage the man in battle. My arm works even better than before. In a moment, I cut him down like a dog. \n<br><br>\nWhen the deed is done, I walk around the village in search of survivors. In the very last house, I find the woman and the engineer with their arms wrapped around each other and their bodies still. I thought I had saved them—saved *all* of them—from a terrible fate that first night... But my actions had only been the impetus for an even greater tragedy. These innocent people had been caught in the cycle of revenge, and now their lifeless eyes stare accusingly up at me. \n<br><br>\n*Your power did this. Your hate. Your thirst for retribution.*\n<br><br>\nAnd you know what? They're right. *I* did this. It is all because of *me*. As I fight, I only add more links to the chain of revenge—but If I stop, the remaining soldiers will continue to commit their horrid atrocities. So I have to fight. I have no choice. But in so doing, will I, too, become an object of hatred in this world of neverending slaughter? All that lays before my eyes is a crimson world of blood and fire. 	\N	6	6	2021-08-23 11:58:35.045+00	2021-08-25 22:46:20.678+00	en	\N
2	\N	Character Quests	character-Lars	# Lars\n\n#### STORY 1\n\nI inhale a lungful of battlefield air, rich with a mix of gunsmoke and blood. Our operation was a smashing success, but while my fellow soldiers are content going back to base and celebrating our victory, I'm heading out on a new mission. Because the only time I feel alive now is when I fight. Revenge drove me. It's all that ever drove me. But then I ended up killing my own father. And on top of that, it turns out the people I called my family were actually my enemies. What a goddamn joke, right? Anybody else laughing here? \n\nWhen I return to reality, I see piles of corpses everywhere. It's all my doing, this carnage, but instead of rage or sorrow, I just feel a strange sense of calm. Honestly, killing is the only thing that brings me peace anymore. Suddenly, an explosion shakes the ground—a close one. The sky turns red as flames arc up toward the heavens. As I stare at this crimson sky, my heart begins to race. I set out in search of someone to fight, hoping to calm my jangled nerves.\n\n#### STORY 2\n\nThe war has turned in our favor. The enemies we don't kill we send running into the night... But it still isn't enough. I find myself picking my way across a viscera-strewn battlefield just in case we missed a straggler. After a bit, I sense someone hiding behind a collapsed house. Battle fever floods my senses. I raise my sword and leap out of hiding, prepared to strike down my terrible foe. But there, crouching on the ground, is a little girl. \n\n*Goddammit, I think. We're under orders to protect civilians, which means I gotta drag this kid around with me until I find a place to dump her off. What a pain in the ass.*\nI extend a bloody hand and grab the girl by the arm. She screams. I don't care. I give her a good yank and start walking. She responds by pinwheeling her other arm and toppling face-down into the mud. That's when I realize the kid is blind.\n\n#### STORY 3\n\nThe girl, still sitting on the ground, grabs my hand and says, \n"Oh no, mister! You're bleeding. Are you okay?\n" The question hits me wrong, and I smack her hand away. After that, we wait in a long, uncomfortable silence.\n\n"It's not my blood," I say finally, as much to break the silence as anything else. I wipe my hand on my pants to clear off as much gore as I can, then help the kid up. Her hands are so damn *soft*. I'd forgotten hands could be soft. The only thing mine are good for any more is murder;\nit's hard to believe her hands and mine are the same thing. \n\nWith no other choice, I throw her across my back and start working my way back to base. I can feel the kid's warmth against me. And there, in the strange silence you always get on a battlefield after a fight... The only thing I can hear is the beating of my own heart.\n\n#### STORY 4\n\nEventually, we make it to a field hospital. It's a nice place, actually, with sunlight coming through the windows and wind rustling the trees. The kid seems okay with it, at least. She lies on a bed, her gaze trained on the window to her side. \n\n"Hey, kid," I ask her. \n"What were you doing on the ground back there?" \n\nShe pauses for a second, then speaks. She tells me how she'd been neglected by her parents her whole life before they finally abandoned her once the war came home.\n\nWhen her story is done, she turns her head in my direction and asks:\n"What color is the sky right now, mister?" I take a look out the window.\n\n"Blue," I say. \n"A nice, deep blue." \n\nShe closes her eyes—I have no idea why—and begins to try and imagine what blue might look like. I don't know why I feel uneasy here, but I do. Something about being near this kid puts me on edge. My heart is racing again but in a different way than the discomfort I've felt for my entire life. And as I try to identify what this strange feeling is, I picture the color of the sky in the girl's imagination.\n	\N	4	6	2021-08-22 17:34:46.475+00	2021-08-24 14:14:29.735+00	en	\N

As I scan the quiet forest in search of any possible threat, the prince at my side murmurs, "Its so peaceful here."\n<br><br>\nHe is here in search of a way to lead our country out of war. And as he travels from nation to nation preaching his message of peace, I walk at his side to protect him from those who refuse to listen. But I am a clockwork man created for war, and no matter how much time we spend together, the truth of his message continues to elude me. I draw close to the prince as he contemplates the setting sun. I wonder why he would think this place to be "peaceful." Perhaps it has something to do with the red hues of dusk? \n<br><br>\n#### STORY2\n\nAs the prince's disease worsened, so did grow his impatience. It would seem he desires to achieve peace as quickly as possible. So when I suggest we rest in a church until he feels better, it takes a good deal of effort to get him to agree.\n<br><br>\nToday again, the prince's condition is poor, so we wait for nightfall in the church. I take this opportunity to ask him: "What is a peaceful world?"<br>\nHe looks at me with surprise, but a willful flame burns in his eyes. After a moment, a thin smile crosses his lips. He reaches out, puts a hand on my chest, and says,<br>\n"It means you never have to hurt *here*."<br>\nIt must be a different sort of pain from wounds as I know them. He does not notice my lack of understanding and continues to talk. I simply nod my head, hoping it will bring him energy.\n<br><br>\n#### STORY 3\n\nThe disease spreads. The prince's body withers and fades. When he can no longer stand, I travel alone to nearby villages in search of any food or medicine they can spare. In the villages, I see people driven mad by the horrors of war. They grieve for lost family. They curse their empty bellies. And they all turn their weapons on me—the clockwork man. \n<br><br>\nOne day, I find a single apple in the woods. My prince lacks the strength to eat it on his own, so I chew small bites and feed it to him as a mother bird would its own young. As I see his haggard cheeks and hear his final, gasping breath... I feel a pain deep within my chest and finally realize the truth of everything that my prince has been fighting for. \n<br><br>\n*It means you never have to hurt here,*\n<br><br>\nhe had said.

7	\N	Character Quests	character-Argo	#Argo\n\n#### STORY1\n\nMy life's mission is to explore the entire world, for only great hardships can make me feel alive. Everything besides adventuring is merely a footnote. I wager I'll feel this way until the day I die.<br><br>\n\nI've faced the challenge of many unexplored regions in my life: Mountains untrodden by man, scorched deserts, frozen islands, pitch-black forests, caves that lead to an endless abyss... So many adventures I can't even remember them all.<br><br>\n\nJust the other day, my wife and I learned that our long-awaited first child was in her belly! Of course, I wanted to help however I could, Which is why I left our snug house in the snowy mountains and began the long climb down. My destination is a small nearby town. How long has it been since I've made this trip? My wife is usually the one who does the shopping. In any case, I don't mind doing what I must to help out during this time.<br><br>\n\n#### STORY2\n\nI haven't tasted the bustle of civilization in a long while, but I pay it little mind as I search for the shops my wife told me about. Heh. It's funny how quickly I get turned around in the streets—if only I was navigating a mountain path instead!<br><br>\n\nAs I wander about, a merchant calls me over. He recognizes me as a renowned adventurer, and he says he has items he wants me to look at. He has a keen eye, this shopkeeper! Ha ha ha! The shopkeep lays out several items across his display: flint to create bonfires, a talisman that wards off illness, and ice that never melts, even under the hottest of suns. All extremely useful items on any adventure! He claims these items are all in high demand, so I buy them on the spot. Lady luck is really smiling on me today!<br><br>\n\n#### STORY 3\n\nThe moment I leave the stall, reality smacks me in the face: I spent all our money and didn't get a thing my wife wanted! Ah, well. Nothing to be done about it now. So I sell my coat and use the money to buy what I came for. Not the smartest thing to go coatless in the dead of winter, but I'm hearty—I'll find a way to survive. Mine is a body forged in the fires of countless journeys. It'd take more than this to do me in!<br><br>\n\nAs I make my way back up the mountain, a blizzard suddenly comes upon me. <br>\nI'm cold—*really* cold—but I spy a nearby rocky shelter and decide to hunker down, As I settle in, I try to start a bonfire with my new flint. But the moment I strike it, the damn thing shatters into pieces. It's a dud—talk about unlucky.<br><br>\n\n#### STORY 4\n\nSomehow, I manage to make it home through the wind and snow. When my wife sees me, she demands to know why I was wandering around without my coat on. so I tell her the whole crazy story. Still, I'm pretty excited about my two remaining treasures!<br><br>\n\nThat night, I am plagued by a high fever. You expect this kind of thing when you walk around in a blizzard without a coat, but it means my talisman that wards off illness is *also* a bust! Another dud! Can you believe it? Trying to kill the fever dead, I put my never-melt ice in a sack and set it on my forehead. I bet you can guess how this goes... I take the bag of lukewarm water off my head and toss it aside in disgust. That damn shopkeep took me for all I had! Still, it's not all a loss;\nI live on a snowy mountain... So if it's ice I need, I just have to walk outside! Ha ha ha ha ha! \n\n	\N	6	6	2021-08-23 18:54:17.575+00	2021-08-25 23:40:26.918+00	en	\N
3	\N	Character Quests	character-Griff	# Griff\n\n#### STORY 1\n\n"What should I do...?" I sit in the briefing room, continuing to turn the problem over and over in my mind. I've been up all night thinking about it and am now beyond exhausted. See, I have to write a telegram to my family back home, but I can't think of a single thing to say. My squad came back victorious from battle a few days ago, at which point everyone sat down and wrote their parents just like always. I joined the army eight years ago... And I haven't contacted my family a single time. It would be strange to send them something now. Crazy. And every time I think back on my time with them, I come up with more excuses not to do it.\n\n#### STORY 2\n\nMy fellow soldiers are loud and boisterous, like always. I begin to wonder what kinds of messages they send. I sit still and listen in, hoping it will give me a better idea of what to write.\n\nOne man says he sent his parents a telegram about being promoted to captain. It's not true he made it up—but his parents love hearing stories about how successful he is, so he figures it's okay to stretch the truth a little. \n\nAnother man's telegrams always focus on memories he and his parents made together. Today's letter is all about how they used to play ball with each other; he claims it will distract them from how lonely they are now that he's gone.\n\nEveryone speaks so cheerfully about the thought they put into telegrams home. And though they are my comrades—and my friends—I can't help but feel the gulf between our lives.\nThe worlds we grew up in were too different. \n\n#### STORY 3\n\nHere's the thing: Ours is a country that values military might above all else, but my parents? They're both anti-war activists. Needless to say, their beliefs earned me more than my share of dirty looks and unkind whispers when I was a kid. \n\nOne day, the army shot and killed my father. What a joke, right? He's spent his entire life preaching peace, then died without accomplishing a single damn thing. I took a lesson from that: Give your life some meaning. Make it *matter*. Later, I decided to join the army and climb the ranks—but when I told Mom about my plan, she said I was insane. The moment she spoke those words, I knew I had to get out of that house. So I slammed the door and stormed off, then spent years trying and failing to forget the empty look in her eyes as I departed.\n\nIn an ironic twist, I never did climb the ladder the way I swore I would. But today, after eight years spent trying to bury every last memory of my family, I finally figure out the telegram I want to send: It's an apology.\n\n#### STORY 4\n\nI'm nervous after I send the telegram. What if she doesn't respond? Hell, what if she disowns me? I couldn't blame her for that. But before I can think too hard about it, I get her response:\n\n*Honey, I'm just so glad you're alive.*\n\nWhy was my father an anti-war activist, anyway? Why did my joining the army weigh so heavily on my mother? I don't have a clue, because I've spent my whole life actively avoiding a search for those answers. The mistakes I made in the past will never go away. But as I think of my military companions and their families, another thought comes to me: I risked my life for these people. Gave everything for them. And I'm more proud of that fact than anything else. But while I salute them, I doubt it will convey these feelings that well up within me.\n	\N	4	6	2021-08-22 17:39:05.419+00	2021-08-24 13:58:26.976+00	en	\N
9		Event Stories	Record: Sunset Port	# Record: Sunset Port\n\n#### STORY 1\n\nA lone woman silently walks beside a sparkling sea where sunlight glistens on the water. She is elegance personified, her black swimwear giving her the appearance of a gossamer butterfly. This place is not her home. Rather. she has come here to complete a single mission. She has been tasked with slipping aboard a nearby ship and stealing a person's life. For this woman is an assassin. But though this is not her home, the place is not entirely unfamiliar. She has been here once before—long, long ago. As she gazes out at the light playing over the water,\n\nshe thinks back on that time.\n\nShe was young then—so young—her spirit not yet worn thin by the passing of years.\n\nShe journeyed to this place as part of her rigorous training, tasked with locating a corrupt politician from a rival country. Then, as now, the port was a lively place, with ships from around the world moving in and out on a regular basis. It was a city filled with all manner and races of people, and no one paid any mind to the innocent girl who walked among their number. This was exactly how she wanted it; the more they overlooked her, the easier it would be to gain the information she sought. After a bit, she learned her target would soon be attending a political gathering aboard a ship. But she did not know the identity of the ship, and their number was legion. If she were to sneak aboard the wrong one, all of her careful planning would be for naught. But as the girl pondered this dilemma... A shock raced through her body. Focused as she had been on the ships, she did not notice the young boy running along the pier and had smashed straight into him. \n\n#### STORY 2\nThe girl on a mission collided with a young boy along the water's edge. Though clad in fine clothing, he raised his voice in a most undignified howl as he lay upon the ground. Blood trickled from an injured knee. As passers-by began to turn and stare, the girl knew she could not leave the boy as he was.\n\nAs she began tending to his wound, she asked him: "Where are your parents? Can I take you to them?" But the boy's lowered head only shook back and forth slowly.\n\n"I don't know where my father is," he said in a wavering voice\n\n"All I know is that he's leaving soon for an important meeting."\n\nThe boy's voice hitched on the edge of a sob. As it did so, a thought came to the girl. *Perhaps his father is the one I seek*. If the boy was the son of a politician, it would explain his fine dress. With this in mind, the girl cheerfully agreed to help him find his missing parent. His eyes glistening with tears, the boy handed her something in a wordless gesture of thanks. It was a small, scuffed figurine of a kind and dignified woman. She was the heroine of a fairy tale told and retold in the boy's native land.\n\n"She's you!" said the boy as he broke out into a smile. \n\nBut the girl just looked away. Because she knew she did not help the boy out of kindness. \n\n#### STORY 3\n\nThe girl needed to locate the politician's ship as soon as possible. Grasping the boy's hand, she began pulling him up the beach, hoping against hope he would see a familiar sight. Suddenly, his face brightened. "Father!" he cried as he slipped from her hand and began to run. The girl took off after him. Turning around, the father smiled as his son leapt into his waiting arms.\n\n"There you are!" he said.\n\n"You almost made me miss my meeting" \n\nThe father tilted his head to mutter a word of thanks to the girl, then began carrying his son onto the ship. A sliver of a smile flickered across the girl's face before vanishing as quickly as it came. Almost as if it was never there at all. This was her ship. All that remained was to make her way aboard and learn what she could.\n\nShe immediately began formulating her plan. But as her mind whirled, she noticed a woman moving silently into place behind her. The woman was familiar, for she came from the girl's own house. She had been sent to the port to monitor the girl and ensure the mission was a success. But they were never supposed to interact. Her appearance could only mean one thing: The situation had changed.\n\nThe woman leaned down and whispered fiercely in the girl's ear:\n\n"He means to declare war. We must act. Leave none alive." \n\n#### STORY 4\n\nThe deck was slick. The corpses were still. Her blade was red. In less time than it takes to draw a breath, the girl and her monitor had slaughtered every last person on the ship. The woman wiped the blood from her blade with a practiced hand and spared a glance at her charge.\n\n"Ever seen this many bodies before?" Though the girl would not meet her gaze, she nodded slowly.\n\n"Of course. Too many times to count." The woman chuckled.\n\n"Right, right. Forgot you're the boss's daughter." The girl sheathed her blade in silence.\n\nBy chance, her eyes darted to the water, where she saw the figurine she had received slowly bobbing up and down. Hearing the boy's words in her mind, she dropped her eyes. He was right. She was exactly like the figure—a helpless thing being tossed about, an assassin forever at the mercy of the waves.\n\nYears have passed since that day. The woman shakes her head to clear her thoughts as a bell rings out announcing the arrival of a ship. She knows her targets are aboard. They are foreign politicians who scheme to infiltrate her homeland. Her mission is to prevent that—by whatever means necessary. The woman stands some distance away and watches the passengers disembark. One particularly large man steps off clad in nothing but a loincloth. *Must have been hot in there*, thinks the woman idly. But the next person to step off brings a small shiver of delight. It is her target. Her lord's orders were clear: She was to prevent the invasion of her homeland. She was to kill the target with all speed. It was the same reason she had stained another ship in crimson all those long years ago. The reason why she took the life of the young boy. And the reason why she still remembers the figurine to this day. The one that was exactly like her.\n\nA haze of melancholy passes over her face as she looks out over the distant horizon. *I wonder where that thing drifted off to*. But she shakes off her momentary fugue and begins walking after her target. The footprints she leaves in the sand are stolen away by the waves.\n	\N	6	6	2021-08-24 16:12:33.399+00	2021-08-24 21:06:45.344+00	en	\N

They stand there proudly as they stretch up to the sky, and the color reminds all who pass of blood. But these spikes are not there to keep intruders at bay; our family has no need of such defenses. None ever approach our house, which is known as The Demon's Den. And if some foolhardy brigand ever did so dare, he would soon learn that a death on the spikes is much, much sweeter than what awaits behind our doors. No, the spikes are not meant to keep people out; they are there to keep the demons in.<br><br>\n\n\n#### STORY 2\nOur training is harsh. Our work cruel. Our teachings inhumane. One might expect that there would be those who are unable to stand it, and scheme to escape. And in fact, there have been a few brave souls who attempted to cross the wall. But every single one of them was killed; the crimson spikes serve to remind us of this fact.<br><br>\n\nI personally knew one man who plotted escape. He was the elder brother of the lord in power—my uncle. My uncle objected to an assassination demanded of him. But when he tried to flee, he met the same fate as those who did so before him: his head put on display for all to see.<br><br>\n\n#### STORY 3\nMy family's teachings are impossibly strict—and as the daughter of the lord, I was not exempt. If anything, my teachings were even more severe. It was only natural given my standing. There are no smiles in a house of assassins; we are showered with naught but shouting and demands.<br><br>\n\nMy uncle, however, always had time to spare a grin for me. He was the only one who ever did. But on that grim day, his smile vanished. His younger brother cut him down to set an example, and his face would forevermore be frozen in a rictus of pain. I learned many hard truths on that day: I would never cross the spikes. Kindness has no meaning. My life is nothing but orders and blood.<br><br>\n\n#### STORY 4\nTime passed and I took over the household from my father. Now, I am able to freely come and go as I please. Yet somehow, I remain an assassin. A thought came to me just now:<br>\nDo I blame the spikes for my murderous ways?<br>\nAm I a bloodthirsty ghoul who uses my job and those spikes as an excuse to kill?<br>\nDo I willingly<br>\nreturn because it is the only place where I will ever find acceptance?<br><br>\n\nAs I look up from outside the wall, the familiar sky stings my eyes. Did I...make a mistake somewhere? The same questions roll ever onward in my mind yet all I can do is surrender myself to my own dark thoughts.\n	\N	4	6	2021-08-22 17:26:13.236+00	2021-08-25 22:56:22.32+00	en	\N

The female is 2B: A powerful warrior who fights on the front line. The male is 9S: A support unit who aids 2B from afar. When they fight as one, nothing can stop them. But 9S has a secret: He wants to free 2B from her world of unending war. \n\nOne day, as they pursue yet another enemy, they find themselves making their way through a massive limestone cavern. Foes attack them and fall, one after the other. The machines stand no chance against them. \n\n#### Story 2\nThey proceed deep into the cavern, then deeper still. Finally, they reach their destination. The darkness is absolute. But the moment they step forward, they are enveloped in a brilliant red light. Only then does 9S realize his mistake. The enemy has been using electronic camouflage. There are machine lifeforms here—dozens of them. Suddenly, 2B emits a heartrending scream. She is infected with a virus—a weapon designed to destroy an android from the inside out. Her eyes begin to glow red. It is a worst-case scenario, and 9S knows the best thing for him to do is abandon the fight and retreat. But he refuses to even consider this option. He will save 2B. He must. For that is his purpose in life. In a desperate maneuver, he links himself to her infected mind and begins diving into its deepest, most hidden parts.\n\n#### Story 3\n2B's mind is a maze—a labyrinth. Finally, he throws open a door and beholds a strange sight: Flickering memories of himself, all from the perspective of 2B. He sees himself in a forest of metal. A frozen ocean. A boiling desert. But he remembers none of this. And all the memories end in exactly the same way: With 2B killing him. She does so over. And over. And over. And over. And over. And over. But for each death, there is also a first meeting. Each time, he says, "People who know me well usually call me Nines." He says this dozens of times. Hundreds. \n\n#### Story 4\n\nIn another part of 2B's mind, 9S locates the virus and disables it. The enemy stumbles in response to the unexpected counterattack, and the two take advantage of the situation to escape. Later, 2B reports the completion of their mission. \n\nAs 9S lends his damaged companion a shoulder, he thinks: *"Why does 2B kill me? Why are my memories erased? And why do we always meet again?" *\n\nThe answer eludes him, and he cannot find the words to ask. However... So long as he remains in her mind... So long as a part of him is in her memory... He doesn't care how many times she kills him. \n\nTheir fate is a never-ending spiral, and they cling to its threads. So 9S walks on through the darkness. \n	\N	4	4	2021-08-26 02:41:41.694+00	2021-08-26 02:47:51.484+00	en	\N
11	\N	Event Stories	Record: Garden of Benediction	# Record: Garden of Benediction\n\n#### Story 1\nOnce, a small girl lived in a town far away. Her family is poor, and though times are rough, she lives her life to its fullest as best she can. Her days are often spent playing alone in a ruin outside of town. She has no friends, so this run-down building is her only companion.\n\nHer days are ones of hardship. But today, she is filled with life and energy. Or so she desperately wants to believe. For today is her birthday. But there is no delicious feast waiting for her. No presents. And no one to celebrate her special day—not even her parents. So instead, she celebrates alone. \n\n"Happy birthday!" she cries to herself, causing warmth to blossom in her chest. She spins in a circle, imagining herself as a beautiful ballerina. She sings. She dances. She tries all the fun things she can think to do. Because this is her birthday party. A day to forget the pain of everyday life. And more than anything else, she wants this day to be special. \n\n#### Story 2\nThe lonely birthday party continues. The next event takes place on a craggy stone table. The girl begins forming something out of dirt and mud. It is a grand birthday cake—one far too big for a single person to consume. It seems impossible that someone so small can construct such a thing, let alone that she could build it at all. For her mother and father have never celebrated her birthday. Though she had always wanted a party, she knew her parents were too destitute to do such a thing. And as a result, she has no idea what a real cake is supposed to look like. Or taste like. Or smell like. The only thing she knows for certain is that they are delightful. More than anything, she wants to share a cake with her family someday. And with that dream in mind, she continues to build her creation. \n\n#### Story 3\nHer dirt cake slowly takes shape. Though it is a tad off-kilter, she finally completes it. But as she gazes at her creation, she notices something is missing. She needs to add something very, very important. And she knows exactly what it is: The cake has no candles. She begins searching for branches that can act as a suitable substitute. She knows she needs as many straight little twigs as her age. After a bit, she begins breaking off branches and whittling them down. She will not compromise on the candles. A cake only becomes grand with proper candles, after all. \n\nSuddenly, a sweet scent wafts over her. It is the most lovely thing she has ever smelled. Was someone baking treats nearby, maybe? The question lingers in her mind as she finishes collecting her sticks. But when she turns back to her cake, she is greeted by an unbelievable sight. Her creation of dirt and mud has transformed into a real cake. \n\n#### Story 4\nThe cake the girl worked so hard to make has somehow become real. White cream. Colorful fruit. The girl cannot hide her joy. Her cheers of celebration quickly turn into song. The happiest birthday song ever sung fills the quiet of the ruin. And in the far-off shadows, something watches. It is a strange creature—neither human nor animal. It had been unable to turn away from the girl as she played, and could not help but interfere. Even though such a thing is forbidden. \n\n"Just..." \n"Just for today." \n\nThe strange creature holds the warmest wishes for the girl. And seeing her smiling face, it knows these wishes have come true. \n\n"Happy birthday, little one." "Here's a present from Mama." \n\n\n	\N	4	4	2021-08-26 02:49:34.406+00	2021-08-26 02:52:01.769+00	en	\N
12	\N	EX Character Stories	excharacter-lars	# Lars\n\n#### Story 1\nCheers ring out from the dusty barracks. In a shift from the tense atmosphere on the eve of their operation, the soldiers now laugh easily with each other as they celebrate the great victory they have won. "Cheers!" Golden ale flows freely and without formality of rank. The men drain glass after glass, scarcely noticing how much they are spilling in the process. Their unit had \nsecured a miraculous victory, and this party is their reward. But they are drunk on more than ale this night; they took on an impossible mission and came back alive, and this fact alone makes their heads swim and their speech giddy. Men brag of their accomplishments in battle. They brag about the beauty of their wives. Every lip is loosened and free. Apparently some of the soldiers even earned promotions for their valor on the mission. But inside this bright atmosphere, a single young soldier sits apart from the others with a glum look on his face. He had infiltrated the enemy base alone—against the orders of his direct commander—and slain the enemy captain. Though their victory was due in large part to this deed, his actions were still troubling. No matter how well it had turned out, he had ignored a direct order from a superior; a court-martial would be unsurprising. That he did so because of a personal grudge is perhaps the most troubling fact of all. By all rights, he should have died on that battlefield. But his life was saved by his fellow soldiers—and especially by the quick thinking and bravery of the very captain whose orders he was so quick to disregard. Regardless, the boy sits alone, not bothering to thank the men around him or share a meal or drink. His mind is still back with the enemy commander. The same man who killed his parents so long ago. After years of chasing him, the boy had finally cornered his target and plunged his weapon in hate. But the fall of the curtain on his revenge was hollow. He felt no accomplishment. Instead, he was left with the empty bones of a past he could never reclaim. With that gloomy sadness filling the boy's head, the dying enemy captain spoke to him. He told the boy something that turned everything he'd ever believed on its head. And now, he sits among his celebrating fellows and replays the words over and over again in his mind:* The secret of my birth. My past. My true father.* It is so farfetched as to stretch the bounds of credulity, and yet he is unable to set it aside. \n\nThe boy stares blankly into space. The drink in his hand has long since grown warm, but he pays it no mind. Suddenly, a brawny soldier approaches him. Ignoring his troubled state, he plops down beside him with a most inconsiderate thud. This man had always treated the boy harshly—more like an enemy than a fellow soldier in the ranks. \n\n"You here to pick another fight?" asks the boy. He can't even bother to lift his head for the query, feeling all the more gloomy from the man's presence. "Fight? No, boy. I'm damn proud of you." The boy is shocked to hear actual praise coming from the man. So shocked that he looks up in spite of himself. There's a slight hint of envy in the words, as if the man wishes he had the outs \n\n	\N	4	4	2021-08-26 02:54:44.633+00	2021-08-26 03:24:21.577+00	en	\N
